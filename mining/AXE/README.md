# This AXE is highly experimental, and I would NOT recommend ordering parts or PCB until the design can be proven. Experimentation is the spark that ignites innovation, the cornerstone of progress, and the gateway to discovery

This design uses the legendary open-source miner, the [Bitaxe 204](https://github.com/skot/bitaxe/tree/ultra-204), as its foundation.
